# Lung-Nodule-Detection

 In this project deep learning architectures will be applied on the dataset from Lung Nodule Analysis 2016 which consists of 3D CT scan of patients. The initial task is to use segmentation techniques to detect nodule images from non-nodule images. Data Preprocessing and Data Augmentation constitute two most important steps in the Image preprocessing.
